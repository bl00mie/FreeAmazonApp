This script will automatically "buy" the free android app of the day from amazon.com

Requirements:

python v 2.5-2.7
mechanize

if you need mechanize, you can simply install it to your system with easy_install
> easy_install mechanize

alternatively, you can create a virtual environment and install it there:

from the directory where getapp.py is, run the following commands
> virtualenv .

Unix: 
> source bin/activate
Windows: 
> Scripts\activate.bat

> easy_install mechanize


To run:

First, modify getapp.py with any editor -- change amazon_username to your amazon username (usually the email you used to create the account), and amazon_password to the value of your password.

Then simply run the script.

> python getapp.py


Enjoy!
